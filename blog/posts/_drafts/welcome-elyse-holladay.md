# Elyse Holladay heads 2015 Speaker Selection

We've done some great things here at SassConf, but, like most, we're always growing and improving. 

Elyse Holladay, Front-End Architect at Retail Me Not, has been part of SassConf since our innagural year in 2013 when she took a risk on a first time conference and came to participate as panelist—forever immortilizing the SassConf panel as one our must-have conference events. 

Elyse is incredibly active in her local Austin community. What caught our attention, however, were a series of tweets and conversations over delicious food and wine—because Elyse gets how we roll at SassConf—about wanting to start a conference to better aspects she was experiencing as an attendee and speaker

Instead of starting something new, we reached out to Elyse and offered her the oppotunity to come to SassConf to help us get better. We couldn't believe she said "Yes!". 

We are excited and honored to work with Elyse Holladay. Already her contributions have been paramount. We're excited to see how our CFP process plays out this year. While blind reviews and/or anonymous CFP processes may have worked for other conferences, it didn't work for us. Having someone on our team that is 100% dedicated to ensuring our stage reflects the diversity, that we as Sass community members are incredibly proud of, of the Sass community.
