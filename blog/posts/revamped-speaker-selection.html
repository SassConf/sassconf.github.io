<p>You may have noticed that we’re doing things a little bit differently this year, and we wanted to tell you why.</p>
<p>While the past two years of SassConf have been amazing, we think we can do <em>even</em> better. We’re aiming for even more unique content from each speaker, consistently high presentation quality, and diverse types of sessions. We want to keep our attendees engaged, inspired, and in the conversation.</p>
<p>The Sass community is also one of the most inclusive, open-minded, and diverse communities in tech, and we intend to honor that by being inclusive and diverse—both in our speakers and our attendees.</p>
<p>This year we&#39;re honored and excited to have Elyse Holladay run speaker selection and scheduling. She’ll be inviting speakers to SassConf, as well as curating the open <a href="https://github.com/SassConf/2015-austin-speaker-cfp">Call for Proposals</a>.</p>
<h3>Invites, Outreach, and an Open CFP</h3><p>We were inspired by <a href="http://2015.cascadiajs.com/">CascadiaJS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jsfest/oakland-cfp">JSFest/CSSConfOak</a> open call for proposals and outreach efforts, along with Karolina Sczuaar&#39;s work on <a href="cssconfoak.land">CSSConfOakland</a>’s. </p>
<p>We moved to GitHub because it:</p>
<ul>
<li>helps us keep better track of all the submissions;</li>
<li>you can see what else has been submitted to get ideas;</li>
<li>allows us to comment and discuss submissions with you;</li>
<li>allows the community to chime in if they’re excited about a talk,</li>
<li>and your submissions reamin editable until CFP closes!</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe that by being intentful about our speaker selection we can improve the quality of our event all around. Our efforts this year will be focused on reaching out to as many people as we can, getting the best proposals possible, and curating an interesting, diverse, and high-quality speaker line-up. After speakers are selected, we’ll be mentoring and working closely with speakers to create the best possible talk they can give.</p></div></article><section class="section section--bordered"><h1 class="section-title"><strong>Call for Papers is open</strong> until May 20th.</h1><p>We're looking for new and experienced speakers for <a href="https://github.com/SassConf/2015-austin-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/submission-guidelines.md">various speaking opportunities</a> at SassConf 2015. <a href="https://github.com/SassConf/2015-austin-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/selection-process.md">Selection process</a>, <a href="https://github.com/SassConf/2015-austin-speaker-cfp/blob/master/docs/speaker-benefits.md">speaker perks</a>, and other <a href="https://github.com/SassConf/2015-austin-speaker-cfp#more-details">details</a> are available.<p><a href="https://github.com/SassConf/2015-austin-speaker-cfp" class="btn">Submit your proposals</a></p></p><p>Questions or concerns, open an issue on Github or email a member of the SassConf Team.
