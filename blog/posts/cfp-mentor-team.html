We aim to have a quality event with unique and interesting talks, but we know that doesn’t happen in a vacuum. Not everyone is a natural public speaker, or knows how to make a great coding exercise, or maybe you aren’t sure what to speak about. That’s OK!</p>
<p>I’m so proud and happy to announce our CFP Mentors for 2015. This great group will be available for office hours or chat to help you with anything CFP related!</p>
<p>Not sure what to speak about? Not sure what type of submission you should make, or if your talk is relevant (it is)? Just need to brainstorm or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">have a rubber duck to talk to</a>? Have specific questions about how to structure your proposal or your talk? Ask the CFP mentors!</p>
<p>They’ll be available for office hours in 30 min blocks. They’ll also be occasionally perusing the submissions and may ask questions or chat with you on there, so don’t be surprised if you see them commenting!</p>
<h2>Your 2015 CFP Mentors!</h2><p>&nbsp;</p>
