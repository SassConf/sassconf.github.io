# Blind Review Did not Work for Us

We know this is a big change from blind reviews and community voting, so it’s important for us to be transparent about our reasons and our process.

We don’t believe blind review or voting is a good way to select talks. As a blind reviewer, you have very little information other than the abstract. Theoretically, this is to limit bias and discrimination against certain groups, whether that’s women, queer/trans people, or well-known conference speakers. In reality, if you don’t have a diverse pool of proposals to select from, it doesn’t make for a more diverse lineup. Additionally, between multiple abstracts that sound very similar, it’s hard to tell which proposal might have better content, be from a better public speaker, or from a new speaker who deserves a chance to share his or her voice.

As a conference attendee, you’ve probably filled out the incredibly long voting surveys. We don’t believe it’s the attendees’ job to pick talks, nor do we think those long surveys really get the job done. How many of you go through and carefully vote on _every single proposal_? How many of you give up after a page or two—and how badly does that skew the voting?
