<p>Elyse Holladay, Front-End Architect at Retail Me Not, has been part of SassConf since our innagural year in 2013 when she took a risk on a first time conference and came to participate as panelist—forever immortilizing the SassConf panel as one our must-have conference events. </p>
<p>Elyse is incredibly active in her local Austin community. What caught our attention, however, were a series of tweets and conversations over delicious food and wine—because Elyse gets how we roll at SassConf—about wanting to start a conference to better some of the not-so-great things she was experiencing. </p>
<p>Instead of starting something new, we reached out to Elyse and offered her the oppotunity to come to SassConf to help us get better. We couldn&#39;t believe she said &quot;Yes!&quot;. </p>
<p>We are excited and honored to work with Elyse Holladay. Already her contributions are paramount. We&#39;re excited to see how our CFP process plays out this year. While blind reviews and/or anonymous CFP processes may have worked for other conferences, it didn&#39;t work for us. Having someone on our team that is 100% dedicated to ensuring our on stage </p></div></section><section class="section newsletter"><div class="content"><h3>Don't miss a thing!</h3><h5>Sign up for the SassConf newsletter and you'll be the first to know when speakers are announced, tickets go on sale, and more!</h5><br/><div id="mc_embed_signup"><form id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" action="http://Sassconf.us5.list-manage1.com/subscribe/post?u=3a8cdc2c932e9e39b71ad40fa&amp;id=bbb1e76d11" method="post" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank" class="validate"><div class="mc-field-group"><label for="mce-EMAIL"></label><input id="mce-EMAIL" type="email" value="" placeholder="Email Address" name="EMAIL" required="" class="required email"/><input id="mc-embedded-subscribe" type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" class="mail-btn"/></div><div id="mce-responses" class="clear"><div id="mce-error-response" style="display:none" class="response"></div><div id="mce-success-response" style="display:none" class="response"></div></div></form></div></div></section></main><footer class="section"><div class="content"><br/><h5>© 2015 SassConf Inc.
