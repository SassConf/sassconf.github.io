        <p>A ticket to SassConf includes two days of track talks and lightning talks, four workshops at a variety of skill levels, and - for the first time ever - moderated small group discussions.</p>

        <p>The third day is our signature Unconference - an organic day where attendees can present, hack, and learn together. Of course, you’ll be there for all the parties & all-speaker panel.</p>

        <h4>Can you contribute to our Scholarship Fund?</h4>
        <p>Not everyone has the financial capability to attend conferences, and this burden falls heavily on already marginalized groups. Help us make SassConf diverse not only on-stage but off too by contributing to our Scholarship Fund! Your help—as well as sponsorships—will be crucial to making this happen.</p>
