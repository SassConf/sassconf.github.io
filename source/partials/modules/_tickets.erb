		<h3>Get a Ticket</h3>
        <p>A ticket to SassConf includes two days of talks, lightning talks, four included workshops at a variety of skill levels, and for the first time this year, moderated small group discussions.</p>

        <p>The third day, our signature Unconf is an organic day where attendees can present, hack, and learn together. And of course, youâ€™ll be there for all the parties & our much beloved all-speaker panel. In addition, we are offering four workshops as add-ons to your ticket.</p>
