        <p class="wide">Brazos Hall is a turn-of-the-century warehouse building at the corner of 4th and Brazos, right in the heart of downtown Austin. Hang out in the huge restored downstairs to watch the talks; catch the all-speaker panel and closing party upstairs on the open-air roofdeck.</p>

        <p class="wide">For lunch, wander to all of downtownâ€™s myriad restaurant options, relax on the Capitol lawn with sandwich, or hop over to famous South Congress Ave for something a little more funky.</p>

        <p>Stay tuned for Unconference & workshops venues!</p>
