      <p class="wide">SassConf is a 3-day event that brings together a far-flung community of front-end developers, designers, architects, and web enthusiasts who dream of building a better web. Originally born out of NYCâ€™s <a href="http://www.meetup.com/gothamsass">GothamSass meetup</a>, SassConf has grown from a language-specific conference to an event on the cutting edge of front-end technology.</p>

      <p>The Sass community is a welcoming, ego-free, open-minded, and diverse group of people. We strive to make SassConf reflect and further that atmosphere. At SassConf your eyes will be opened to how technology can create not just websites, but revolutionary change.</p>
