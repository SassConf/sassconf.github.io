title: 2015 Submission Statistics

This is an interesting post, I swear! Crunching the numbers for the 2015 submissions was actually very eye-opening and exciting, so please don't close this post before you start!

We had 81 total submissions in 2015!

* Discussions: **5**
* Lightning Talks: **27**
* Talks: **38**
* Workshops: **11**

<em><small>The above numbers are total submissions; about 14-18 submissions were tagged in 2 categories.</small></em>

If workshops are 3 hours, talks 1, discussions 1, and lightning talks .25, that’s a grand total of **83 hours of content**! And while we seriously debated making SassConf two weeks long, in the end, we couldn’t pick everything. (Sad trombone.)

**2014 vs 2015**

So how did we stack up compared to last year?

* 78 total -> 81 total
* 57 unique submitters -> 67 unique submitters

In 2014, 21 of the 78 talks were submitted by someone who had more than one in the running. In 2015, we're down to 14! We love when people submit more than one thing, as it gives us more options, but it's also great to see that we had more total submissions and more unique submitters!


#### Who submitted?

In our earlier post, <a href="/blog/posts/changing-our-cfp/">Why we’re changing our CFP process</a>, we told you that last year we had **less than 5% of submissions from women.** We also said that <em>“women aren’t the only measure of diversity, but it’s the only quantitative data we have from 2014. Another goal for 2015 is to have more data on the SassConf community to share.”</em>

While we didn’t get a 50/50 _submission_ ratio, we definitely improved on last year in this regard. And we definitely have more data!

We had:

* **67** unique submitters. Of those,
* **48** (72%) were men
* **19** (28%) were women. 

> Submissions from women went up to 28%<br/> from last year's 5%!

Thanks, ladies, for making us look so good!

We gleaned some other demographic data about our submitters, as well. 

* Black Men: **2** 
* Black Women: **1**
* Asian Men: **4**
* Asian Women: **1**
* Latina: **2**
* LGBTQ+: **5**

> This means 22% of our submissions were from people of color or queer!

I had a secret, personal goal to get 50% submissions from diverse speakers. Deep in my heart, I didn't believe it would happen. I didn't do as much outreach as I had intended, so I was sure we didn't make it. BUT, and this should go to show how diverse the Sass community is...

> 42% of our submissions were from women, LGBTQIA+, or people of color!

<em><small>Disclaimer: This is fairly surface level, based on photos/names, locations, and public social media information. We can’t guarantee this data is 100% accurate. A particular note on the LGBTQ+ stat: we only had info on this based on Twitter, knowing people, etc. There may be more, but we did not and would never explicitly ask for this information.</small></em>

I was also surprised how many varied locations our awesome submitters are from! We had representation from 5 continents, only missing out on Africa and Antarctica. (Where my Antarctica developers at??)

As for CFP mentoring, it was a relatively small but very rewarding success.

> 13 people asked (and received) CFP mentoring office hours.

All but 4 submitted their talks. We don't know why they chose not to submit.

> Overall, CFP mentorship was great, and I’m really psyched we had the program. I had some great moments with Adekunle and it was awesome to see him go on to CSS Conf with the talk we worked out. Nice to see our resources help not just make great talks for SassConf but also empower the Sass community to speak elsewhere. — Scott Kellum

Overall, we had a very successful CFP and the overall quality of submissions was fantastic. I know a few of you had concerns about the open CFP on GitHub, but we didn't get any email/private submissions.

I’d also like to note that I didn’t see _one single mean comment_ on any submission. I did see quite a few +1s and thumbsups and comments along the lines of “I really want to see this talk!” Y’all are such a wonderful, nice, tech community! I am so proud of you and to be among you. Thank you.

#### Where can we improve?

Overall, I feel we did well. That said, there are a handful of places we can improve upon for next year.

Firstly, and most glaringly, is the lack of submissions from people of color. For a conference with quite a few people of color on its organizing team, we dropped the ball here. The only way to increase the possibility of speakers of color is to increase the number of submissions.

As I mentioned before, I should have done more outreach. Karolina tweets about the work it takes to ensure a diverse event, and she isn't lying. Outreach is hard, and time consuming. I am sorry I did not to more. It would have improved our submission rates all around, I am sure.

For CFP mentoring, our two most obvious points of improvement are to follow up with everyone who had a session before the CFP closes, and to be better at assigning sessions. We had 4 mentees not submit, and I wonder what would have happened if we had gotten back in touch with them before the CFP was over. We also struggled (as volunteer groups do) with staying on top of incoming requests and scheduling sessions. In the future we can do better by having one person assign sessions, rather than asking the group who is available.


#### Suggestions?

More than anything, our goal was to make this year's CFP better for you as submitters, and to reflect the diversity of the Sass community.
