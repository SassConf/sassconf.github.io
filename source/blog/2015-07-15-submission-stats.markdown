title: 2015 Submission Statistics
date: 2015-07-15

We crunched the numbers from 2015 and the results were revelatory. For starters, we had 81 total submissions!

* Discussions: **5**
* Lightning Talks: **27**
* Talks: **38**
* Workshops: **11**

<em><small>The above numbers are total submissions; about 14-18 submissions were tagged in 2 categories.</small></em>

If workshops are 3 hours, talks 1 hour, discussions 1 hour, and lightning talks 15 minutes, that's a grand total of **83 hours of content**! We  seriously debated making SassConf two weeks long, in the end we couldn’t pick everything.

#### 2014 vs 2015

So how did we stack up compared to last year?

* 78 total -> 81 total
* 57 unique submitters -> 67 unique submitters

In 2014, 21 of the 78 talks were submitted by someone who had more than one in the running. In 2015, we're down to 14. We love when people submit more than one thing, as it gives us more options, but it's also great to see that we not only had more total submissions, but also had more **unique** submissions.


#### Who submitted?

In our earlier post, <a href="/blog/posts/changing-our-cfp/">Why we’re changing our CFP process</a>, we told you that last year we had **less than 5% of submissions from women.** <em>“Women aren’t the only measure of diversity, but it’s the only quantitative data we have from 2014. Another goal for 2015 is to have more data on the SassConf community to share.”</em>

Our goal was to end up with a 50/50 submission ratio, and though we didn’t end up meeting it, we definitely improved over the last two years in this regard.

<em><small>Disclaimer: These numbers are surface level; based on photos, names, public social media information, and personal knowledge. We cannot guarantee this data is 100% accurate. We do not and would never explicitly ask for demographic information, particularly LGBTQIA, as we recognize the importance of privacy in this regard.</small></em>

Of the total 81 submissions in 2015, **67** were from unique submitters. Of those.

* **48** (72%) were men
* **19** (28%) were women

> Submissions from women went up to 28%<br/> from last year's 5%!

We gleaned some other demographic data about our submitters, as well.

* Black Men: **2**
* Black Women: **1**
* Asian Men: **4**
* Asian Women: **1**
* Latin@: **2**
* LGBTQIA: **5**

> This means 22% of our submissions were from people of color, queer, or trans!

We had an organizational goal to get 50% submissions from diverse speakers. Deep in my heart, I didn't believe it would happen. I didn't do as much outreach as I had intended, so I was sure we didn't make it. BUT, and this should go to show how diverse the Sass community is...

> At least 42% of our submissions were from women, LGBTQIA+, or people of color!

We were also surprised how many varied locations were represented by our awesome submitters! We had representation from 5 continents, only missing out on Africa and Antarctica. (Where my Antarctica developers at??)

> We had 40 unique locations, 11 of which were not in the United States.

#### CFP Mentoring

The newly introduced CFP mentoring team was a relatively small, but a very rewarding success.

* 13 people asked (and received) CFP mentoring office hours;
* all but 4 submitted their talks

> CFP mentorship was great, and I’m really psyched we had the program. I had some great moments with Adekunle and it was awesome to see him go on to CSS Conf with the talk we worked out. Nice to see our resources help not just make great talks for SassConf but also empower the Sass community to speak elsewhere. — Scott Kellum

#### The open CFP process

Overall, we felt that we had a very successful CFP. The overall quality of submissions was top-notch, and we were pleased with the process being open on GitHub. We made sure submitting privately via email was an option (in the CFP readme as well as on Twitter), and while a few of you expressed concerns with the open format on Twitter, we didn't get any emails or private submissions.

We also didn’t see _one single mean comment_ on any submission. We did see quite a few +1s, thumbsups, excellent questions, and comments along the lines of “I really want to see this talk!”. This was fantastic and we hope for more public participation in the future.

Y’all are such a wonderfully nice community! I am so proud of you and to be among you. Thank you.

#### How can we improve?

Overall, we feel we did well. We certainly did better than the previous years, and we met our general goals. That said, there are definitely areas for improvement next year.

Firstly, and most glaringly, there is still a tremendous lack of submissions from people of color. For a conference with quite a few people of color on its organizing team, we failed to see any improvement in this area.

The only way to increase the possibility of speakers of color is to increase the number of submissions. And the only way to increase the number of submissions is to directly encourage and ensure our POC members are submitting. We believe this starts at the local level.

Karolina tweets about the work it takes to ensure a diverse event, and she isn't lying.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The “ugly” truth about community and diversity work is that it’s extremely hard and exhausting.</p>&mdash; fantastic ms. (@fox) <a href="https://twitter.com/fox/status/601342111405969408">May 21, 2015</a></blockquote>

Outreach is crucial, and difficult, and time consuming; we should have done more. It would have improved our submission rates all around.

For CFP mentoring, our two most obvious points of improvement are to follow up with everyone who had a session before the CFP closes, and to be better at assigning sessions. We had 4 mentees not submit, and I wonder what would have happened if we had gotten back in touch with them before the CFP was over. We also struggled (as volunteer groups do) with staying on top of incoming requests and scheduling sessions. In the future we can do better by having one person assign sessions, rather than asking the group who is available.


#### Suggestions?

More than anything, our goal was to make this year's CFP better for you as submitters, and to reflect the diversity of the Sass community. If there's anything you think we could have done better (or did well, we like compliments too!) please don't hesitate to reach out: <a href="mailto:elyse@sassconf.com">elyse[at]sassconf[dot]com</a> or<a href="mailto:claudina@sassconf.com">claudina[at]sassconf[dot]com</a>.
