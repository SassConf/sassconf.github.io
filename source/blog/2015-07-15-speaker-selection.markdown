title: How we did Speaker Selection
date: 2015-07-15

Our motto for speaker selection in 2015 was this:

> “more unique content from each speaker, consistently high presentation quality, and diverse types of sessions.”

#### Goals

To get to this summarized goal, we came up with a list of things we wanted to focus on during the entire process.

* high quality of speaker performance & content
* diversity not just of speakers, but of types of content (technical, non-tech, interpersonal skills, fun) and formats (length, discussions)
* taking care of and helping our speakers
* reviewing speakers slides, content, CFPs to make the best proposals and talks possible
* transparency in publicity of CFP and why we care
* recognizing personal achievements to eliminate fear of tokenism

As mentioned <a href="/blog/posts/changing-our-cfp/">here</a>:

“It isn’t that blind review processes don’t work at all, but it didn’t work for us. In 2014, we fully anonymized our submissions...those were voted on by a community review board... Then we uncovered the names... and were utterly confused. We had only three women and no (visible) racial diversity in our talk lineup. Our diversity problem wasn’t with the blind reviews: it was with the submission pool. Of the total submissions, less than 5% were from women. If you don’t have a diverse pool of proposals to select from, it is impossible to expect a diverse lineup... It was a clear moment for us. This meant more than just putting out a CFP and getting some retweets from people championing for opportunities for diversity.”

So from day one, we knew we had to do something different. At SassConf 2014, much of the content of talks overlapped. I felt that more collaboration with and between speakers, as well as more intent in the choice of talks, would lead to more unique content.

Making the choice to do the CFP open on GitHub was a scary, but I think ultimately effective one. This allowed us to help submitters craft a better proposal; we could (and did!) ask questions about their content, and we saw many positive changes. It also allowed for us, during reviews, to be intentful about the topics we selected.

Does that mean we were “biased” in some ways? Yes! We were absolutely biased towards selecting content that did not repeat itself, was relevant to the current industry trends, inspired and strengthened the community, and would be entertaining and enjoyable. We also were “biased” towards representing as many viewpoints, backgrounds, new voices, and styles as we could. 

I expected, as we went into selection, that we would struggle with this scary conundrum: choosing between two similar talks, one of which was from a diverse candidate, with no other information to go on. In fact, the only situations where this arose, we did have other, very relevant information to help us decide. Has one of these submitters given their talk elsewhere, or is it videotaped? Is one more technical than the other? What is our technical vs non-technical content ratio? Does this person get paid to speak or teach? In every case, there were many factors that helped us decide the right balance of content versus speaker diversity. No speaker was selected based on their race or gender alone.

#### Process

After the CFP closed, we made the GitHub repo private. This allowed us to tag and sort the submissions without prematurely notifying anyone! 

Claudina and I both did a first pass; we tagged some number of submissions for a first pass. We chose to not accept almost half of the submissions on our first pass.

We chose not to accept submissions based on the following factors:

* a confusing, cryptic, or too terse of a proposal
* technology/tool specific
* topics we felt we had seen too often or were not unique
* topics we felt were not particularly relevant to Sass

I want to pause here and talk about “topics we felt we’d seen too often,” as this is a hairy subject. I firmly believe that (especially as a beginning speaker) you should speak about what you know. Even if it’s something that is at many events and has been done many times, there is a time and place for you to give that talk. Unfortunately, it is not always at big conferences. We absolutely don’t want to discourage anyone from submitting a talk that’s “been done,” but it’s also important, as a conference, to have content that is timely, new, and unique.

We also struggled for a long time over the “technology or tool specific” talks. We had so many good submissions that fell in this category, from Compass to Susy to email to Rails... But in the end, we felt that we wanted to focus on Sass: how to use it, how Sass is transforming our work and lives, and how we are transforming Sass, not specific “how to”s.

Next, we tagged the remaining submissions for a second round. This left us with 34. Of these, we accepted a handful almost immediately. Some just stood out to us, for a variety of reasons, some <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that left us thinking, “we have to see this talk!”


A few, we had followup questions, ranging from asking to see code excerpts to whether or not the speaker was a first-time speaker or not. We followed up with these people privately.

Some we tagged for the Unconference. This did NOT mean we thought it was second-rate, or not good enough for the real conf. Instead, we felt that these talks were more suited to a smaller group or more organic setting. Some of these were the more tools-specific talks. A regular conference complaint is not getting to try out or implement the new skills you learned. We wanted to direct some of these talks to the more hands-on environment of the Unconference, so attendees could truly soak up the knowledge, rather than just listen.

At this point we excluded workshops and discussions. We had few enough workshop/discussion submissions that we could choose based on prior critera and the type of content we were aiming for.


#### Scheduling

Throughout the entire selection process, we kept a calendar open and created draft schedules. We wanted to make sure we had time to fit in all the content we wanted, without creating painfully long days for our attendees. Breaks, the infamous long SassConf city-exploring lunches, and a variety of talk length and content were all considerations.

As much as we wanted to make SassConf two weeks long, we worked incredibly hard to fit as much content as we could into two days without sacrificing our attendees’ experience.


#### Community Review

Now came the hard part! We had 21 talks left, and <em>they were all excellent.</em> (Seriously though, every single submission we had was great. This was a couple weeks of agony for us, trying to decide!)

Time for community review! We anonymized these 21 talks to remove names, employers, or any other identifying information, put in a Wufoo form and sent them to about 30 people. Some were well-known community members and previous SassConf speakers, and we included CFP mentors, some non-speaker non-well known Sass developers, as well as some people not actively involved in Sass but who have experience running other conferences or with speaker selection. Our goal here was to get a) an idea of what people wanted to hear about, and b) what experienced conference/community members felt would make for a good talk.

We got 23 responses. It was only a little bit helpful. Dividing negative/neutral and positive votes, only 6 of 21 talks made it above a 1. (e.g. 14 negative/neutral votes divided by 3 positive votes, 0.2.) Of those 3, only 3 were above a 2 ratio. Most of the talks were in the 0.3-0.8 range, a solid “this is good; I’m neither jumping for joy nor bored to tears by this.” I think that people didn’t want to shoot down good talks; they were all good, and they got votes accordingly.

Unfortunately, we still had to choose! The 3 most positive talks were chosen; a handful of the lowest-ranking talks were not chosen. These votes were in line with our initial gut feels about these submissions. The talks in the middle we reviewed again. They were all good, and I am confident that we could have picked at random and had an excellent lineup. We looked in depth at the talks we already had accepted, and made sure our content was as diverse as possible, choosing unique topics over potentially overlapping ones. Hands down this was the most difficult part of selection... except for every time we had to tag something “not-accepted”! Heartbreaking!


#### Confirming & Invited Speakers

When we began the CFP, we knew there were a few people we wanted to have speak at SassConf. We chose one speaker for each format: talk, lightning talk, discussion, and workshop. For the workshop we wanted to guarantee a beginner-level topic; for the discussion, someone who we trusted to carry on an enjoyable, non-contentious, interesting discussion in a group. 

After confirming with our four invited speakers, we reached out via email to the other 20 speakers we wanted to accept. 

> We had a 100% confirmation rate for accepted submissions—in under 48 hours!

Excitingly, every single one of our accepts said yes! 

Be sure to check out the accepted speakers on the homepage or in <a href="/blog/posts/speakers-tickets/">this blog post</a> and give them a high five on Twitter for their awesome work—and all the work they have ahead of them!

#### What’s Next?

Now it’s time to announce! Speakers are out, tickets are out, and we’re well on the way to SassConf 2015! Next we’ll be collaborating with our speakers, reviewing their slides and scripts, and finalizing our schedule.
