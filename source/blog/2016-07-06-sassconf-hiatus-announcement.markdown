title: SassConf 2016 Hiatus Announcement
date: 2016-07-06

Hello All!

We regret to inform you that SassConf has decided to go on hiatus this year. We’ve truly had an amazing time these past three years and are completely overwhelmed by the sheer love and support from the Front-end Development and Design community. We realize this announcement is unexpected and you’re probably swarming with questions so we’d like to address what we think are the most pressing ones here:

##### Why is SassConf going on hiatus?
Although SassConf has an organizing team, it is supported by a wide number of volunteers, many of whom sacrifice their limited personal time to make things work. Apart from our intense personal schedules, we really want to take a collective step back to brainstorm and regroup on what community means to us all, what we’ve learned from past conferences and how we can improve upon the overall experience for the community.

##### Is SassConf disappearing for good?
We’d like to think not! SassConf is community-driven and community focused; and providing the best experience for the community means diving in to the community and really listening to members' needs. Where are we needed the most? What interests us as a collective? Are we being fully representational of who we are? What have we done well and where do we need improvement? What direction should we move in going forward? Is the community satisfied? This is the time we’re taking to hear our collective voice to make SassConf more beneficial to us all. Please do share your thoughts with us.

##### Bummer. I was really looking forward to SassConf; what am I supposed to do now?

##### I’m a locally involved community member and would like to keep the spirit of SassConf alive this year. What do you suggest?
Totally do it! We’re stoked that you feel this way. Might we suggest you organize a local SassConf MiniConf? Our idea of this is either a one day unconference, or a half-day track/half-day unconference, but do it however you like!

##### I want my voice heard. How can I do this?
If you have questions, comments, suggestions, or just want to say hi please reach out to us! We’re around on twitter as @sassconf or shoot us an email at info@sassconf.com.

Stay Sassy,
