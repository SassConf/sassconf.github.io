# Contributing to SassConf.com

Howdy, thanks so much for helping make our site better! You don't need to fork the repo to make small corrections. GitHub snazzily handles forking from the web UI. If you'd like to make a substantial change, we ask that you fork the repo.

#### All pull requests and changes should be against the `source` branch.

Our site is powered by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a simple static site generator with built in preprocessing.

## Quickstart

To get things running locally, you'll need to have Ruby (preferably with rvm) and [bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed to manage Ruby gems.

1. clone the repo and check out the `source` branch
2. in Terminal, run `bundle install`
3. run `bundle exec middleman` to run the server; it will process Sass and livereload on Sass and template changes.

Submit a PR with your changes & we'll review and merge!

If you have any questions or run into snags, tweet @sassconf.com or email us admin at sassconf.com
