# Contributing to SassConf.com

Howdy, thanks so much for helping make our site better. You don't need to fork the repo to make small corrections. Github snazzily handles forking from the web UI. If you'd like to make a substantial change, we ask that your fork the repo.

**All pull requests and changes should be against the `source` branch.**

Our site is powered by [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/), a simple static site generator with built in preprocessing.

To get things running locally, first make sure you have [bundler](http://bundler.io/) installed to manage Ruby gems. Then clone the repo and in the `source` branch run the following commands:

`bundle install`

`bundle exec middleman`

If you have any questions or run into snags, tweet @sasconf.com or email us info[at]sassconf.conf.
